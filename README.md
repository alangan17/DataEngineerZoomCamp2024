## 🐳Containerization with Docker
A game-changer for application deployment. Resolving the problem of “it works in my machine”. This practice should be shared as a culture rather than just software. In the old world, I wasted tons of days on fixing the package incompatibility problems before I could start my work. 

If you want to experience the magic, all you need is just a browser to a GitHub codespace, then run “docker compose up” in the terminal.



## 🏗️Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
Revolutionized my view on infrastructure provisioning, offering precision and agility. In the old world, spinning up the MVP data stacks would involve a series of boring GUI clicks. But Terraform comes to make it reproducible and simplifies the boring stuff.

Applied refreshed analytics skills on the NYC Taxi dataset
